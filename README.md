# Repository for Research in Weak Supervision for Semantic Parsing

This is a place where the AllenNLP team does some of its research.  The repository is public only
for convenience (so integration with TravisCI, etc., is free).  This is not publicly-supported
code, and we will not be answering questions about it.  If outside people open issues on this repo,
they will probably be closed without comment.

Some of this code may make it back into [allennlp](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp) eventually,
but we make no promises about that.  This is where we are prototyping and experimenting.
